# Arch Linux (btw)

Arch linux is a distribution hailed for its minimalism (it's base bones) and
giving the user ultimate control to customize and build the OS experience the way the
user intends.

## Installation Guide

I will first list the set of features I'm going to implement for this installation, and
then we will start installing arch. Please know that the Arch Linux distribution is on a
**rolling release** basis and there can be breaking changes. This makes it very important
to stay up-to-date with the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org). The users are encouraged
throughout this wiki to cross-reference and check the code with the arch wiki where applicable.
